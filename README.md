# Airbnb clone

This project is part of the Scrimba [React](https://scrimba.com/playlist/pqQgrcN) course. It aims to create a Airbnb Experiences website clone. 

## About The Project

![Airbnb clone screenshot]()

The project is composed of three components: Hero, Navbar and Card. Each experience is stored in the data.js file and retrieved using the map array method.

In order to [avoid treating warnings as errors](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/troubleshooting-tips/#build-fails-on-warning-message) when deploying with Netlify, the build environment (CI) variable is set to an empty string. 

```
CI='' npm run build
```
